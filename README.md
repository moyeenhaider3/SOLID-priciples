# SOLID Principles in Dart

Explore Dart examples demonstrating SOLID principles for clean and maintainable code.

## Principles Covered

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**
   - **Definition:** A class should have only one reason to change.
   - **Example:** [Link to SRP Example](path/to/single_responsibility.dart)
   - **Explanation:** Explore the comments in the Dart file to understand the violation of SRP and suggested improvements.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**
   - **Definition:** Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   - **Example:** [Link to OCP Example](path/to/open_closed.dart)
   - **Explanation:** Review the comments in the Dart file to identify how the code adheres to the OCP.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**
   - **Definition:** Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting program correctness.
   - **Example:** [Link to LSP Example](path/to/liskov_substitution.dart)
   - **Explanation:** Dive into the Dart file's comments to understand LSP violations and suggested improvements.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**
   - **Definition:** No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
   - **Example:** [Link to ISP Example](path/to/interface_segregation.dart)
   - **Explanation:** Check the comments in the Dart file to grasp ISP violations and how to refactor interfaces.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**
   - **Definition:** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
   - **Example:** [Link to DIP Example](path/to/dependency_inversion.dart)
   - **Explanation:** Read through the comments in the Dart file to understand DIP violations and the introduction of abstractions.
